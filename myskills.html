    <center><h1>MY SKILLS</h1></center>
    
<h3>PHOTOGRAPY</h3>
<ul>
    <li><h4>One of my major skills was taking pictures, I was a good at it. It is not a easy skill for me
        first of all because my hands can't stand or stay in place in a long time.
        And to capture a good picture, it is a must. It takes me time to learn this skill of mine.
        Not everyone knows this skills of mine. First because i'm afraid that when they knew about it, they'll
        always ask for me to take picture of them. I'ts not that i don't want to capture good photos of them,
        i just don't like taking pictures of peoples. It is because i'm more on environment type of picture guy.
        I love nature that's why i love capturing good and aesthetic photos of it. This is skill a of mine that 
        that i always love and will always adore </h4></li>
</ul>
<h3>WRITTEN</h3>
<ul>
        <li><h4> I can write hour for hours non-stop. It is a weird skill of mine but it comes handy sometimes. While other
            would prefer typing on keyboards, I prefer writing. It gives me more time for my self and listening to music while i'm writing.
            It also expands my vocabulary, because while i'm writing something i read it and when there are words that are not familiar to me 
            i search it on the web so that i can understand what i'm writing. In fact i once join the writing journalism. And that was the 
            first time i hooked on writing. But even if i write too much, my hand writing sucks hehe.   
        </h4></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>COMPUTER</h3>
    <ul>
            <li><h4> Since i am a Computer Science student, it is one of my skill and classification that i am literated about computer.
                Not only that i know and pretty good on some software programs. I could say that it is really hard to learn computer.
                But then, ever since a kid computer was always a thing on me. It is because the first ever computer we had was the begginning
                of my gamer era. It is because of that computer that's why i'm still hooked on computer nowadays.
            </h4></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>LEADERSHIP</h3>
    <ul>
            <li><h4> I can't say that i am the type of guy that will always get picked as the leader but one of my characteristic is that
                i can lead whenever the group picked me or trusts my leadership. I am a hardworker, so whenever they do that i always do my
                best to lead them as good as possible I can.
